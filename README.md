# MedX
## Medical info-system, written in MERN stack
(Yeah, i`m not very powerfull in naming)

At first i thought to make this as my diploma project, but then i decided this is not the best idea because it might be more difficult that i wanted to be. But eventually, i think it quite good.

**Idea is simple:** info-system, where tou can register/login as patient or doctor. As patient you can plan your visit to doctor, see what recepies he gave you, select doctor. As doctor you can manage your patients, see individual their profiles, set threatment, manage your schedule.
__*(Features are in next sections)*__


## Used technology
* React - well known front-end library
* Redux - for managing states in react
* React Router - for route logic
* Material UI library - because bootstrap is borring, and i personally like Material Design
* Express - back-end framework for NodeJS
* JSONWebToken - for auth purposes
* Sass - for better CSS
* MongoDB - as database
* Mongoose - MongoDB ODM
* Passport - for auth
* ApexCharts - for great looking charts
* Axios - for requests

## Installation
Install dependencies for server
```bash
npm install
```
Then cd to client and install dependencies for client (May take a while)
```bash
cd client
npm install
```
Then change back to root
and you can run back-end and react server
```bash
npm run dev
```
And then open in browser **localhost:3000**
